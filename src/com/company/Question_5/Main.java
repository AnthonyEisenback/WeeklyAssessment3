        we would want to do that.

        /* ANSWER QUESTION HERE:*/

        /**
         * Making a class abstract can allow several like classes access that class. Like if you had a class for vehicles, cars, vans, and Trucks if you made vehicle abstract then they would all be able to access that one class.
         * It does this to help make sharing the classes easier and allow classes to read each other.
         * We want this as it can help us make programs run more efficently and allow us to link classes together.
